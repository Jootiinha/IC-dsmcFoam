Overview
========
- This directory contains files to help post-processing of OpenFOAM cases
- It primariy "packages" functionObject functionality in a convenient form for
  users to plug into their OpenFOAM cases
- While some tools are quite generic, e.g. minMax, others are more application-
  oriented, e.g. flowRate.

How the tools work
==================
- The configuration of functionObjects includes both required input data and
  control parameters for the functionObject
- This creates a lot of input that can be confusing to users
- The tools here are packaged so that the user input is separated from control
  parameters
- Control parameters are pre-configured in .cfg files - users can ignore these
  files
- For each tool, required user input is all in one file, for the users to copy
  into their case and set accordingly

Example of how to use the tools
===============================
Task: monitor flow rate at an outlet patch named "outlet" for a case
Solution:
- locate the flowRatePatch tool in the flowRate directory
- copy the flowRatePatch file into the case system directory (not
  flowRatePatch.cfg)
- edit system/flowRatePatch to set the patch name
  replace "patch <patchName>;"
  with    "patch outlet;"
- activate the function object by including the flowRatePatch file in functions
  sub-dictionary in the case controlDict file, e.g.
  functions
  {
      #include "flowRatePatch"
      ... other function objects here ...
  }

Current tools
=============
- fields          calculate specific fields, e.g. Q
- flowRate        tools to calculate flow rate
- forces          forces and forceCoeffs for incompressible/compressible flows
- graphs          simple sampling for graph plotting, e.g. singleGraph
- minMax          range of minimum and maximum field monitoring, e.g. cellMax
- numerical       outputs information relating to numerics, e.g. residuals
- pressure        calculates different forms of pressure, pressure drop, etc
- probes          options for probing data
- scalarTransport for plugin scalar transport calculations
- visualization   post-processing VTK files for cutting planes, streamlines,...

- faceSource      configuration for some of the tools above
